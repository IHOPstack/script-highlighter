# SCRIPT HILIGHTER

## What is it?

Script Highlighter takes your uploaded pdf of a stageplay, screenplay, or TV script, and highlights the selected character's dialogue with the selected color. You can then download a copy of your script with the highlighted lines.

## Usage

1. Click the 'Upload' button to select your script file (PDF only for now).
2. Choose a character from the dropdown list.
3. Click 'Highlight Script' to highlight the chosen character's lines.
4. Review the highlighted script in the preview area.
5. Click 'Download' to save the highlighted script to your device.

## Development

**Languages, Frameworks, Libraries:** Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, Font-Awesome, Pdf.js

The light weight nature of this application, allows all the functionalities to happen in client-side, protecting sensitive user data and unpublished scripts. This also makes installation easy on the development side, as all that's needed to begin working on this project as a cloning of the repo in a fresh environment.

For those who aren't savy enough to have downloaded scripts on hand, I have provided a folder of (sample scripts)[sample_scripts] that can be uploaded and highlighted to demo the funcitonality.
